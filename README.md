# Student Attendance List Management

This project is a simple Python script for managing a list of students and their attendance via a command-line interface.

## Features

* **Add Students**: Add a new student to the list.
* **View Student List**: Display the list of all registered students.
* **Mark Attendance**: Mark a student as "present" by their number.
